# Laser-Land-Party-Supply-Inventory-System-1.0
This program was created by Noah H. Kim for Laser Land LLC in response to manager Greg Martinez's pleas for the employees, at the Mission Viejo location, to notify him when the inventory of party and cleaning supplies runs low. 

Version 1.0 is intended to:
*Take employee's input of party supplies used each day
*Keep count of the stock of supplies in a JSON file
*Notify the employees when the stock is low and remind them to notify Greg (Version 2.0 will automatically message Greg via a Telegram bot, this is still in development)

IMPORTANT:
Please note, the appJar library is required to run this program! You can install this at http://appjar.info/
